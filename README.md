# RandomDeckGenerator


This is an app I built for a friend, to add items to a list and assign those items Randomly to each card in a 52 deck of cards.

needs some QoL updates to make it a bit more user friendly as well as some improvements to usability in terms of

-Salvable Lists 
-Salvable and reusable sets of data to lessen data re-entry 
-Better visuals

the site is currently hosted on Azure, trying to keep it as free as possible which is why file storage service is being used not the best solution but it is currently free as it has a good free storage plan, so wont use up App Server disk space or need to spend on Database service storage

the site can be accessed form this URL if wanting to take a look.
